# Text-Classification
This repository contains a variety of text classification algorithms, including examples of deep learning approaches. The repository also includes code for preprocessing text data and evaluating the performance of different classifiers.

This code is for classifying text data from the Spooky Authors (train)dataset, which can bedownloaded from Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spooky-author-identification/data). 
The dataset is used to train four machine learning models, including an MLP, LSTM, CNN, and RNN, to classify the text into three categories(authors).
The code preprocesses the text data by vectorizing it using Tf-idf, padding the sequences to the same length, and encoding the labels. The models are then 
trained and their performance is visualized using plots of the mean squared error and accuracy during training, as well as ROC curves for each model.
